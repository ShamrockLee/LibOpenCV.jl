A special package that manages opencv binary depedencies

try to search your system opencv libraries and its dependencies, and throws errors
if any issues. If opencv librarires are not found, it will install fresh opencv
libraries into `deps` directrory, but not recommended unless if you have perfect
requiremsnts to build opencv.

$(SIGNATURES)

It tries to search the specified library by name. Not exported, but meant to be
used by other opencv packages.

**Parameters**

- `mod` : Module name
- `libdirs` : library seach directries (default is dir of `libopencv_highgui`)
- `ext` : library extention name (e.g. `.so`)

**Retures**

- `libpath` : library path if found, othrewise return `C_NULL`

**Examples**

From the [CVHighGUI.jl](@ref) package,

```julia
libopencv_highgui = LibOpenCV.find_library_e("libopencv_highgui")
try
    Libdl.dlopen(libopencv_highgui, Libdl.RTLD_GLOBAL)
catch e
    warn("You might need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to load dependencies proeprty.")
    rethrow(e)
end
